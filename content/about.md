## About

My name is Asindu, and this is my personal blog.

Here I will write about my personal interests, thoughts, travels, recommendations, and stories.

***

Here is what you can expect;

### Personal Interests
I used to consider myself a stoic but later found out,  that I am more of an epicure.
So expect to see articles concerning food.

Concerning non-food, however, I will post about software, programming languages, electronics, and financial markets.

### Thoughts
I often keep notes on thoughts I find interesting, insightful, or worth sharing. It may be unsolicited advice, philosophy (mostly epistemology) or business strategies

### Travels
I may talk about a new location that I happened to visit.

### Recommendations
I love films (both movies and documentaries), music, and books.
I will be posting articles on the ones I like.
Also, I won't talk about something I didn't enjoy.

### Stories
Suppose I have a story that I think is worth telling. I may happen to write about it.
If you want to know more about what I am currently doing. You can check out my [Now Page](/now).
