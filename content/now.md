# What I'm Doing Now

_* Last updated 8th Feb 2025_


### Writing on a Book.

I am currently writing book about the next stage of governance.
The subtitle is, **"The new infrastructure for collective action"**

### Coining a new Open Source Web Development Stack

I just coined a new web development tech stack. I found it very fun & productive to work with
and I will be releasing some libraries, tutorials and documentation based on it. -->
