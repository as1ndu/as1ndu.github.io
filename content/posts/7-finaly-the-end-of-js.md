## The rise of JavaScript


## The problem with JavaScript

The biggest problem with JS is that over the years, it's stake holders failed to morph the programming language into one that would make development the modern web easier.

Why do I still need to install a dependency so I can effectively do data binding & routing? Patterns such as these are so frequently used that they should have been simplified the added to the core of the JS syntax.

But now we are helplessly in need of frameworks to simplify these tasks to the level we feel comfortable. what I mean for example is having something like Mithrill's API being a valid vanilla JS.

Think about it, a few year back before “JS fatigue” everyone thought the standard way of building modern websites would be web-components, & it looked really promising but it’s something no one is taking seriously at this time.

## How JS becomes legacy.

Some of you think JS will still be on the the top programming languages of choice because the langaue is the only one that is widely available in browsers and you know, people spend a significant amount of time in browsers running  JS code.

I never said JS will vanish in to a pile of "no-longer useful tech". I believe JS will evolve into more of a runtime & less of a programming language.

### The rise of WASM

I think people in need of high-performance code like game engines will turn to C, Rust, Nim and compile code to run in the browser via JS as a target via WASM.

### The rise of Flutter

Another reason why JavaScript is most likely to be taken over by a competitor is that it has failed to catch up with two important technological paradigms.

- The rise of ARM
- The end of moore's law

#### The rise of ARM
#### The end of moore's law
- limited compute resources

Dart/Flutter actually handles both the need for modern developers have for cross platform hugely & custom UIs. Flutter is not just another "framework" it’s more of a graphics engine (think the Canvas API in browsers but for any platform).  It’s a complete piece of tech that has;
