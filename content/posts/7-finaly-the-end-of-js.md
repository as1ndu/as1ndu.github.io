The problem with JavaScript

The biggest problem with JS is that over the years, it's stake holders failed to morph the programming language into one that would make development the modern web easier.

Why do I still need to install a dependency so I can effectively do data binding & routing? Patterns such as these are so frequently used that they should have been simplified the added to the core of the JS syntax.

But now we are helplessly in need of frameworks to simplify these tasks to the level we feel comfortable. what I mean for example is having something like Mithrill's API being a valid vanilla JS. 
What philosophy does JS subscribe to? What niche problems does it solve? Is it now a systems programming language?
These questions cannot be answered because the original purpose of JS, adding logic for browser based applications, was given a back seat by its custodians in an effort (unsuccessful one) to make it a systems programming language.

Think about it, a few year back before “JS fatigue” everyone thought the standard way of building modern websites would be web-components, & it looked really promising but it’s something no one is taking seriously at this time.

Web devs are not bad, js is evil

How JS becomes legacy.

Some of you think JS will still be on the the top programming languages of choice because the langaue is the only one that is widely available in browsers and you know, people spend a significant amount of time in browsers running  JS code.

I never said JS will vanish in to a pile of "no-longer useful tech". I believe JS will evolve into more of a runtime & less of a programming language

I think people in need of high-performance code like game engines will turn to C, Rust, Nim and compile code to run in the browser via JS as a target via WASM.

Dart/Flutter actually handles both the need for modern developers have for cross platform hugely & custom UIs. Flutter is not just another "framework" it’s more of a graphics engine (think the Canvas API in browsers but for any platform).  It’s a complete piece of tech that has;

A goal (high performance, highly custom UIs)
A philosophy (they like to brand themselves as real OOP)
Standards (well documented suite of declarative widgets more fun to write than HTML)
Standard package manager (pub)

By the way, this article isn’t a sales pitch for dart/flutter. Over the years, UI development (front-end) has become less & less fun for some & I was discovering that I wasn’t the only one feeling this.

Where you one of these people? Try Flutter/Dart. It re-sparked my interest in building UIs aka frontend. That’s why I wrote this for you :)
