Mitigating BTC volatility with derivatives.

The biggest problem with Bitcoin is volatility. Bitcoins wild variation in price within short intervals. It is not even scalability like advertised. 

it's the price volatility that is keeping business from accepting Bitcoin. Any serious business (that isn't trying to be anarchist or unkown/anonymous) will never accept bitcoin as a payment.

If I am a business & do $1,000,000  in revenues per year (while doing business & keeping the money in bitcoin). Then I loose 80% of my revenue because the market did something funky. It doesnâ€™t really make sense.

But his is not a new problem. Multinational businesses have this problem all the time. A company  like Mercedes (may measure profits in Euros)
may sell cars to a USA consumer (that pays in Dollars). Due to the nature of this engagement, Mercedes faces the risk of loosing part of their revenue
incase the price of the Dollar drops relative to the Euro.
In traditional finance, the problem is known as foreign exchange risk. & is mitigated using derivatives. More specifically futures contracts.

In the crypto space, the issues that arise from volatility are well understood. And several projects are trying to mitigate this using stable coins like Dai.
I think we also should start devoting more efforts to using futures contracts for mitigating price volatility.
How futures contracts basically work is that the gurantee the price at which a merchant will sell their bitcoin.

Lets say you run a small resturant that also accepts BTC, and today you  collect $250 of BTC. The problem with bitcoin is that you can wake up tomorrow
and the price falls by 30%. So you may end up liquidating $180 (loosing $75) just because the "market moved".
But if you where using a futures contract, you would liquidate your  bitcoin at exactly $250.

This is one of those many, solutions crypto should borrow from traditional finance.
It even gets more interesting, wallets can include futures contracts to work under the hood, & allow give ordinary users.
A great use case of this would be, ordinary people that want to use bitcoin but are not interested in speculating on it.

Such a wallet can have features like, stable mode (where the price of your bitcoin neither depriciates nor appreciates) or cowboy mode
where the price is determined stricly by the market & expected to vary wildly.

We can even have further provisions like allowing a user to store money in portions. For instance if my salary is $1000 per month.
I can recieve my expenditure (rent, groceris) say its 70%, in a futures contract thus hedging my risk from price volatility & my saving in bitcoin
Incase I am also in to "digital gold", I get to save the $300 also in BTC but unhedged since I think bitcoin may be worth more that $300 in the distant future.

We already have infrastructure for this, infact, Arthur Hayes talked about how we can create stable bicoins (sythnetic USD using Bitmex derivative contracts).
Besides Bitmex, we also have like LedgerX offering this kind of institutional grade financial instruments. 
On the other hand, decentralized derivative platforms like Synthetix & UMA are starting to pick up some steam.

It's ironic how speculators, are often potrayed as greedy mindless agents that markets can do without. But in this case for example,
they are useful. The volatitity one would experiece from using BTC with futures contracts doesn't simply vanish into thin air.
Speculators take on that risk and that makes them our heroes of the day.
