Languages like J however were designed to be a replacement to traditional maths notation - an interface for thinking or a tool of thought as their inventor Kenneth E. Iverson called them in his Turing Award lecture.\nIn this blog post I am going to introduce the J programming language by using it as a \u0026ldquo;tool of thought\u0026rdquo; to explain the 1 dimensional random walk.\nTo try out the code yourself you will have to install the J interpreter. The easiest way to get it working on Mac is through running the brew formula brew install --cask j. For other platforms, see the installation instructions.\nFirst, a random walk in 5 lines. # The 1 dimensional random walk is a toy model used in finance for creating what may look like stock market prices. In it\u0026rsquo;s simplest form, a 1 dimensional random walk consists of;\nSeveral steps (a list of values), and at each step (for each value) it is either up (indicated by +1) or down (indicated by -1). Note that the value of each step -1 or +1 is chosen at random. Hence the term \u0026lsquo;random walk\u0026rsquo;. So a random walk is basically a list of -1 and +1 generated at random. To attain the \u0026lsquo;synthetic price\u0026rsquo; or what looks like stock prices, we simply compute the running sum of this list of random -1 and +1 integers. The entire toy model of prices we described above is created using the J code below. Let me describe how.\nload 'plot' NB. Import the utility for plotting charts indices =: ? 100#2 NB. Generate indices walks =: indices { _1 1 NB. Use indices to create list of -1 \u0026amp; +1 integers running_sum =: +/\\ walks NB. Compute synthetic price plot running_sum NB. Plot the running sum Generating indices. # An index refers to the position of an item in a list. For example, the list 1 2 3 4 has the indices 0 for 1, 2, 3, with the index 0 referring to 1, the index 1 referring to 2, the index 2 referring to 3 and the index 3 referring to 4.\nLine 2, indices =: ? 100#2 generates indices as follows. The # symbol takes in two values 2 and 100 and what it does is that it \u0026ldquo;copies\u0026rdquo; 2 into an list 100 times. For example 5#1 copies 1 five times to give 1 1 1 1 1. So 100#2 returns 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... 2 up to the 100\u0026rsquo;th 2.\nThe ? symbol generates random numbers, you can think of it as rolling a dice. For example, ? 5 may randomly return 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. So ? 5 can be read as \u0026ldquo;generate a random number below 5\u0026rdquo;, 0 is included since the values ? generates are always greater than or equal to 0.\nAnd finally to generate a list of random numbers, we simply give ? a list of numbers for example ? 3 3 3 3 3 may generate 1 1 0 2 2 i.e 5 random numbers under 3. Recall that in line 2, 100#2 generates a list of one hundred 2\u0026rsquo;s. ? then takes the list of one hundred 2\u0026rsquo;s and for each 2 it generates a random number less than 2 i.e 0 or 1.\n? 100#2 can be read as \u0026ldquo;generate a list one hundred 2\u0026rsquo;s and for each item in the list, generate a random integer less that 2\u0026rdquo;. This will return a random list of 100 items made up of exclusively 1\u0026rsquo;s and 0\u0026rsquo;s looking like 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 .... We then store this in a variable called indices using =:\nThis is what we shall use as our indices.\nUse indices to create list of -1 \u0026amp; +1 integers. # In line 3, we use our list of 0\u0026rsquo;s and 1\u0026rsquo;s as indices to generate a random walk (random list made up of -1\u0026rsquo;s \u0026amp; +1\u0026rsquo;s). To do this, we use the symbol { in indices { _1 1 that takes in two sets of values, first is the variable indices which is a list of randomly generated 1\u0026rsquo;s \u0026amp; 0\u0026rsquo;s. On the other side of { is _1 1, which represent the directions of our random walk _1 for -1 (down) and 1 for +1 or (up).\nWhat { does is that it \u0026ldquo;pulls\u0026rdquo; items from a list given an index. The list _1 1 has the indices 0 for _1 and 1 for 1, recall that an index refers to the position of an item in the list. So the statement 0 { _1 1 would return _1 and 1 { _1 1 returns 1 from the list.\nA list of indices would also return a list of items, for instance 1 0 0 1 { _1 1 would return 1 _1 _1 1. Which is similar to what indices { _1 1 is doing. Since indices is a list of random one hundred 1\u0026rsquo;s and 0\u0026rsquo;s it will also randomly pull out a list of _1 and 1 thus giving us a list like _1 _1 1 1 _1 _1 _1 _1 _1 _1 1 _1 ... up to the one hundredth index. Which is the random walk of 100 steps.\nWe also store this list into a variable walks using =:.\nCompute the synthetic prices. # In line 4 we use +/\\ the running sum of the random walk. For example +/\\ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 computes the running sum of seven 1\u0026rsquo;s, which gives us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. Which is exactly what we do with +/\\ walks.\nSince walks is made up of randomly generated _1 and 1, it\u0026rsquo;s running sum will equally fluctuate up and down. The running sum of 1 _1 1 _1 _1 _1 1 1 1 _1 _1 will look like 1 0 1 0 _1 _2 _1 0 1 0 _1\nThe running sum (synthetic price) +/\\ walks is then stored inside the variable running_sum with =:\nA random walk in 2 lines. # This post was supposed how to create a random walk in 2 lines of J. So below is the exact code above refactored to run in two lines.\nload 'plot' NB. Import the plot library plot +/\\ (?100#2) { _1 1 NB.

The source of excitement is the idea is that you can use financial markets to do inference — just like machine learning.\nA famous example of such prediction markets are the orange futures. The orange futures market is one that allows entities to buy oranges in advance. How it works, is that one can pay $1,000 to receive 1,000 oranges that will be delivered next year. An interesting side effect of this orange futures market is how it accurately predicts temperatures in certain locations more specifically, the temperature of the locations where the oranges are from.\nBut how is information on temperature reflected in the market meant for selling oranges? Well, what actually happens, is that the orange futures prices rise towards cold weather and drop towards warm weather.\nThis phenomenon can be easily explained by the fact that cold weather reduces orange yields thus causing prices to rise (reasoning from the perspective of supply \u0026amp; demand). This explanation however doesn\u0026rsquo;t account for the fact that the market prices start reacting to temperature changes before they occur. It is as if the market knew what the temperature would be in the future. Hence the name prediction markets.\nHow to buy information from the future # In the example above, predicting temperatures was just a side effect of the orange futures market. But how do we design a market to predict an explicit event? For example, say you want to know if it will rain tomorrow.\nStep 1: Declare an event that will reveal this information — Say you want a market that can predict the weather. For the rain example we can declare the event \u0026ldquo;It will rain tomorrow\u0026rdquo;. Step 2: Define events outcome — Formalize the outcomes of the event. The event \u0026ldquo;It will rain tomorrow\u0026rdquo; has two out comes Yes and No. Step 3: Sell betting tickets — Sell tickets for the event outcomes \u0026ldquo;It will rain tomorrow\u0026rdquo;. Buyers of the tickets have two options Yes tickets and No tickets at equal prices. Buyers are allowed to trade tickets with each other. If it does rain tomorrow, those with Yes tickets receive money 2 times the price of the tickets \u0026amp; those with No get nothing. If it does not rain, those with Yes tickets get nothing \u0026amp; those with No tickets get money 2 times the price of the ticket. Loosely following assumptions made by prediction market theory, the true information on the event outcome for \u0026ldquo;It will rain tomorrow\u0026rdquo; will be reflected reflected in the prices at which buyers are trading the tickets. The ticket with the highest price is the event outcome that is most likely to occur. If Yes tickets are selling for $2 \u0026amp; No tickets are selling for $1. Then we would assume that it will probably rain tomorrow.\nThe assumptions of prediction markets # Prediction markets operate upon 3 main assumptions. The first assumption is that markets are made up exclusively of 3 types agents. A classification of these agents is as follows.\nThe pure gambler, this one doesn’t have the necessary meteorological information. He/She is simply betting at random. The accurate information trader, these traders have information they think points to the fact that it will rain \u0026amp; they are right. Inaccurate information traders, have information they think points to the fact that it will rain. But they are wrong. The second assumption, is that The Information is predictable, this means that amongst all the market participants, at least agent is an Accurate information trader.\nThe last assumption is that people in these market agents will perform a Rational participation. Rational participation means that, speculators will always prefer to place bets on event outcomes which they think they will make money \u0026amp; they will decline from participating in bets where they think they will lose money. For instance, a rational person should not be a pure gambler because they have higher chances of making money by betting on information they know at least something about.\nThe accurate information trader on the other hand will flourish in this market as they will always have the edge in the market \u0026amp; thus make money off clueless gamblers \u0026amp; people signaling wrong information. Meanwhile, agents that always bet on wrong information will go bust or switch to markets where they do better. This is what makes prediction makers so resistant to market manipulation, it’s a system where agents signaling wrong information actively subsidizes people signaling correct information.\nIn theory, markets that repeat themselves should improve with every iteration (since most agents that signal wrong information are bust). Provided all agents have access to finite amounts of money.\nHow to break a prediction market # Prediction markets may be highly resistant to manipulation, but that does not mean they cannot break. For a market to continue doing correct inference (accurate predictions), the sum of money held by the class of Accurate Information traders should always be greater than the sum of money collectively owned by the rest of the agents. This is because all agents have finite amounts of money. And it will not be possible to offset noise incorporated into the market by agents with bad information. This may however improve in subsequent iterations of the market (agents signaling wrong information go bust) thus giving prediction markets a self healing like property.\nIt is often mentioned that prediction markets are based on \u0026ldquo;The wisdom of the crowds\u0026rdquo; \u0026amp; that creates a false analogy where people this it works for the same reason democracy does, but they are actually based on the wisdom of the rationals, a system where people don’t talk about what they don’t know.\n","content_html":"\u003cp\u003eFor years now I have been fascinated by prediction markets.

This isn\u0026rsquo;t even the worst case, pandemics like the the black plague killed over 200 million (60% of Europe\u0026rsquo;s population at the time) about 2 times a bigger death toll than any war we have ever had3.\nPandemics \u0026amp; Preparedness # Pandemics are real \u0026amp; unpredictable as we have seen with Ebola 4, SARs 5, and at the time of this writing, the Corona virus6.\nThe problem is that, we are often not prepared for these pandemics. For instance, during the Ebola pandemic in West Africa, 11,000 died simply because the responsible bureaucrats could not mobilize enough resources in time.\nPandemic Bonds and how they work # There was an idea from the World Health Organization (WHO) to use create a kind of insurance market they call a Pandemic bond.7\nHow it would work is that,\nFirst, a pool of money (equivalent to whats needed to finance an Ebola pandemic) would be put up by speculators. Second, The WHO would then continuously pay the speculators a kind of insurance premium. But if a new Ebola out break occurred in a new country, the WHO would use the pool of money (put up by the speculators) to facilitate the mitigation of Ebola in that region. This is obviously an over simplification of the 300 plus page document that explains how these pandemic bonds actually work8 but I hope you get the idea? Its basically health insurance for everyone subsidized by the WHO. Trust minimized pandemic bonds # The pandemic bonds have however become controversial9 probably due to their poor mechanism design10. Despite this fact, I think mechanism designers can come up with better mechanisms resembling these \u0026ldquo;pandemic bonds\u0026rdquo; that actually work in a society.\nThe great thing about Smart-contracts like Solidity11, Scilla12 \u0026amp; Simplicity13 is that, they allow us to design trust minimized financial instruments, thus incorporating a strain of these pandemic bonds into what is now popularly defined as DeFI or decentralized finance14.\nWe can have several of these DeFi (Decentralized Finance) powered applications to mitigate several problems around disease.\nFor instance, Animal husbandry businesses can pay these premiums to mitigate risks around animal disease pandemics like bird flu or mad cow disease. Charities or Governments can pay these premiums to to secure resources for fighting pandemic out breaks like the recent Corona virus. The recent Corona virus for example is so new, there exists no cure15. In such a case, the pool speculators put up would be used for research towards the creation of a vaccine. Event Derivatives # Another way of using DeFi to mitigate disease pandemics is by leveraging prediction markets like Augur16 \u0026amp; Gnosis17 to create an \u0026ldquo;event derivative\u0026rdquo; that may assist in the mitigation of a disease. Event derivatives are markets that pay people for accurately predicting events in the future18\nAn example event derivative is a market we can call, \u0026ldquo;Will it rain on Thursday, next week?\u0026rdquo;.

A \u0026ldquo;trust machine\u0026rdquo; as some people call it, that will bring the power of finance, data sovereignty and inclusion to the people, hence rendering centralized intermediaries like Visa, Barclays \u0026amp; Facebook obsolete.\nWe shall achieve this by using a combination of robust, battle tested cryptography \u0026amp; game theory.\nWhile this vision is plausible, realising it is not a easy as it may seem.\nThe blockchain is not yet ready.\nThe core barriers to main stream adoption # The blockchain, while being a new concept in decentralized distributed databases has also presented a very unique set of problems in computer science \u0026amp; economics that have never been solved at the time of this writing.\nIs this post, I will talk about the the 6 most important issues only with which if solved, shall we (blockchain enthusiasts) ever achieve our vision.\n1. Scalability Issues # The current bandwidth, i.e the data that can be transmitted through a blockchain with in a given time is simply too bounded for main stream adoption.\nEthereum for instance does a maximum of 13 transactions per second. Visa on the other hand can do 24,000 Transaction per second and peak over 40,000 transactions per second.\nSo as you can see, the blockchain is thousands of magnitudes unable to manage a global traffic of financial transactions. This is what they call the \u0026ldquo;Scalability Problem\u0026rdquo;\nComing up with a solution to scalability the problems without tarnishing the original value propositions of a blockchain (immutability/security, decentralization \u0026amp; censorship resistance) is not trivial. It has been nick named the \u0026ldquo;scalability trilemma\u0026rdquo; by Vitalik Buterine (Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s co-author).\n2. Lack of Intuitive Private Key Management # Ordinary users will simply never wrap their heads around private keys.\nPrivate keys, which are a string of text used to sign transactions and make other proofs(cryptographic).\nThe purpose for these proofs or signatures is for other entities on a blockchain network to verify identities \u0026amp; messages amongst themselves without reasonable doubt.\nPrivate keys have two main problems first, how to store them securely. Anyone who can memorize, take a picture, or copy your private key can literally steal all your money. Because they have your private key, they can make the cryptographic proofs/signatures and accurately prove to everyone on the network they are you even without your consent. Even when they are not you.\nSecond, you loose your key you loose access to all your money \u0026amp; no one can ever help you out. There is no \u0026ldquo;click here to remember your private key\u0026rdquo;\nWe need to first come up with something as intuitive using ATM/Debit cards.\nImagine if your bank told you that, \u0026ldquo;if you forgot your Debit card PIN, you loose access to all your money with zero hope of recovering it how ever large a sum of money it would be\u0026rdquo;.\nIf the above was the case, I don\u0026rsquo;t think any one would use debit cards.\n3. Contract security # It is simply not reliable \u0026amp; safe for responsible institutions \u0026amp; individuals to deploy smart contracts on blockchains like Ethereum.\nDue to the blockchain having an immutable and unpredictable state, Smart contracts deployed on such a platform are also expected to suffer from immutable bugs \u0026amp; unpredictable events.\nAs a result, millions of dollars have been lost in events such as the theft of $50 million from TheDAO and Parity\u0026rsquo;s $160 Million loss of funds\nI was glad that Rick dudley talked about this\n4. Consensus algorithms are wack # The popular blockchains only don\u0026rsquo;t offer transaction finality i.e you will never be 100% sure that you have gotten funds.\nYou can only be probabilistically to a high degree (but with zero guarantee) that you have received your funds. This is because in major consensus algorithm called Nakamoto Consensus, the miners elect the chain with the most computational work that are with in the same protocol i.e consensus rules.\nFor instance imagine your bank tells you that you that, \u0026ldquo;there is a 95% chance that we might have your life savings, however you may also not poses it in 5 years in case we discovered that the chain with the most work does not have your transaction in it\u0026rdquo;\nYes, I don\u0026rsquo;t think anyone wants to keep their life savings in such a bank.\n5. Privacy # Just by knowing someone\u0026rsquo;s cryptocurrency address, you can know their account balance \u0026amp; transaction history simply by pasting it in a blockchain explorer like blockchain and etherscan\nMeaning it\u0026rsquo;s very easy for anyone to keep track of your financial activities without permission.\nYou buy HIV drugs?
