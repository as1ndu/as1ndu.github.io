To me LLMs are more of a research tool like Stack Overflow. I ask it questions about stuff I want to do.\nIt is something for filling my gaps in knowledge. So at the end of the day, I often prefer my own judgement \u0026amp; style. As I don\u0026rsquo;t think vibe coding is an advantage.\nI will try to describe my reasons why.\n1. The economics world is a minority game. # Knowledge work like software development only has value when you know what other people don\u0026rsquo;t. 1\nNot many people will pay you a premium for knowing what everyone can \u0026ldquo;vibe code\u0026rdquo;.\nSo you\u0026rsquo;re better off learning something hard that LLMs won\u0026rsquo;t be able to do.\n2. Vibe Coding is the WYSIWYG of the 2020\u0026rsquo;s # I remember when learning web development in high school and asked my friends why they were stressing with HTML instead of just using Dream Weaver, WiX or Microsoft Publisher — The so called WYSIWYG tools (What You See Is What You Get) that utilized drag and drop for building websites. 2\nThey simply replied with \u0026ldquo;HTML is better\u0026rdquo;. The answer didn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to me then.\nBut now I think I know the answer. Writing your own code instead of using a WYSIWYG gives you fine-grained control of what your working on.\nThink of vibe coding like buying a cake mix (pre-mixed ingredients for making a cake) for running a bakery instead of inventing your own recipes.\nInventing your own cake recipe is hard and slow. But think of everyone else buying the same cake mix to run their bakery.\nThe icing on the cakes might look different but the taste will be the same. So the differentiating factor amongst competitors will be very little.\nI think LLMs will be like spreadsheets for programmers.\nSpreadsheets didn\u0026rsquo;t give normal people CPA level skills, but they did improve the normal persons book keeping skills.\n3. Might cause atrophy of temporal logic. # Atrophy is a biological condition where the body reduces the size and there for effectiveness of an organ. 3\nThis often happens when that organ is not used as much. So maybe the body wastes it way internationally as it may not \u0026ldquo;want\u0026rdquo; to keep on maintaining something that it isn\u0026rsquo;t using.\nThis happens with muscles. So when you stop working out at the gym your muscles start disappearing.\nWhat worries me is that this may happen to skilled programmers brains. The developed faculties of the brain concerning temporal logic 4 might be wasted away such that;\na) Other tasks that might have benefited from your \u0026ldquo;programming cognitive muscles\u0026rdquo; might get harder to do.\nb) It might get harder to learn a new \u0026ldquo;programming like\u0026rdquo; skill that shows up in the future.\nIn London for example, they have a taxi service informally referred to as \u0026ldquo;Black Cabs\u0026rdquo;.\nIt turns out that in order to work for these \u0026ldquo;Black Cabs\u0026rdquo; you are required to memorize over 40,000 streets and landmarks and major buildings. 5\nPeople who qualify to drive for black cabs often develop a bigger hippocampus (part if the brain responsible for memory), and this bigger hippocampus probably helps them memorize stuff more effectively compared to Uber drivers that rely on GPS 6 — a better memory system will also be beneficial to the black cab drivers for tasks that have nothing to do with driving, but require good memory.\n4.

In this blog post, I describe a few take aways from the book that hopefully inspire you to pick it up. ","content_text":"Last year I read a book titled \u0026ldquo;The Nature of Technology\u0026rdquo; by one W. Brian Arthur. After finishing it, it was one of those books that I wish everyone read. Especially if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in technology, technological progress, the notion wealth creation or economic growth. 1\nBrian Arthur is one of those \u0026ldquo;complexity theorists\u0026rdquo;, that is, people that study the relationship between groups \u0026amp; the individual components that make them up.\nAn example is a stock market, you cannot trade stocks by yourself, you need to be in a group to trade stocks with each other.\nThe stock market can be looked at as a lumpy, single or independent system even when it is made up of many agents and the properties of the lumpy stock market may be very different from the properties of an individual agent in the market. Complexity theorists call this a Complex System. 2\nFor people that are not aware of such a definition of complex systems, studying literature of these complexity theorists may just look like inter-disciplinary science.\nBrian Arthur in this book, brings about the mind set of thinking about technologies as a complex system (smaller components interacting to form larger groups) and uses it to provide some insights about technology that may be easy to understand but not blatantly obvious.\nI say this book is a must read because it provides insights into some action points incase you want to achieve some things — somethings that I think everyone might say are good to achieve.\nSo, why should you read \u0026ldquo;The Nature of Technology\u0026rdquo;? # If you want a blueprint for generating tech start-up ideas or come up with inventions that people will find useful the book is for you.\nI often see discussions on social media, amongst friends, politicians on TV, on how cities, countries can become technologically competitive with other regions. One question for example is usually how can we have something like silicon valley in Africa, in Europe etc. Basically other communities wanting to replicate technological success equivalent to that in silicon valley (or just the West) in their own communities. If you want to know how this book is for you. (Hint: the answer isn\u0026rsquo;t more homework time for children).\nA childhood friend of mine and me used to talk about inventors. A lot of people\u0026rsquo;s answers to this question is something like \u0026ldquo;things to invent are over\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the low hanging fruit is gone\u0026rdquo;. This book describes why there is only more stuff to invent and why with every subsequent invention there is actually more potential for people to invent more items or technologies. That is, there will be more, lower hanging fruit as more technological progress is made and more things to invent. The book properly explains why.\nThe aim of this blog post is to write about some of the take aways I got from the book which may address some of the discussions I outlined above.\nIt would be inaccurate to call this a summary the book. The book is short (just under 300 pages), but it\u0026rsquo;s very information dense. So dense I think it is not be possible to soak in everything on first reading.\nTake aways from the book. # Now, for the meat of the article below, are some of the 3 most important take aways I got from reading the book.\n1. Technology relies on phenomena. # The meaning of phenomena is something an event or pattern that can be observed.\nAn example is the phenomena of electromagnetic waves that were investigated by the likes of Heinrich Hertz, Oliver Lodge and Guglielmo Marconi. Which are the basis of telecommunications TV Signals, Radio Signals, GPS, WiFi — basically all of wireless communication. 3\nAnother example is nuclear power that is based on the understanding of phenomena happening inside atoms.\nSo what, this is obvious? you may ask. The important insight isn\u0026rsquo;t that technology relies on phenomena.\nIt is the fact that the discovery of phenomena is a prerequisite to the creation of new technology.\nLet us first think of some practical implications of the above statement. If you want to have an ecosystem that creates new technology.\nWe have to invest in basic scientific research and by this I mean both teleological \u0026amp; non-teleological research whose purpose is to document, curate and study different phenomena. 4\nTeleological research means investing in research whose use is obviously known. Like looking for the cure of cancer, if a break through in made in this field we know exactly how it will benefit society.\nWhat however I think is more important and unfortunately suppressed or discouraged by most institutions is the investment in non-teleological research. That is, the investment into research who\u0026rsquo;s use is not clearly outlined. An example is the study of flocks of birds, the origins of the universe, the behavior of prime numbers.\nSo why should we invest appropriately in research that isn\u0026rsquo;t obviously useful? I gave you the answer earlier. phenomena is a prerequisite to technology, you need to find the phenomena first before you can find something useful to do with it.\nIt will not be obvious what a particular newly discovered phenomena can be used for. When electricity was discovered for example by the ancient Greeks. It was not exactly obvious that it can be used to make power smartphones and light bulbs.\nThe discovery of so called quantum phenomena for example made it possible to invent the laser \u0026amp; the computer transistor.\nAlso, special properties of some prime numbers for example are used in public key cryptography to secure communication across networks like the internet.\nWe simply cannot invent the cryptography first, and then come up with the mathematical properties/phenomena of the numbers later.\nSo if we want people to find new phenomena that may potentially be used to build new technology we need to;\na) Allow students, researchers to peruse topics that are not obviously useful.\nb) If you want to get ideas for new technology to invent. A good way to do so it is to simply study \u0026amp; curate phenomena, in physics, mathematics, biology, economics or psychology e.t.c. And then try to leverage it to do something useful. If you are successful and the first to do so, you probably would have invented new technology.\nI will leave you with an excerpt from the book that expands on this point further.\nThe process is not one that can be easily controlled from the top down. There is always a temptation for governments to pursue science with particular commercial aims in view. But this rarely works. Had there been a stated purpose to quantum physics in the 1920s, it would have been deemed a failure. And yet quantum physics has given us the transistor, the laser, the basis of nanotechnology, and much else besides. Building a capacity for advanced technology is not like planning production in a socialist economy, but more like growing a rock garden. Planting, watering, and weeding are more appropriate than five-year plans\n2. Technology is combinatorial # I was listening to the Lex Friedman interview with Jeff Bezos. And he mentioned something that is relevant to this section of the blog post. 5\nJeff Bezos mentioned in the interview that he identifies with himself as an inventor, what is relevant to the discussion here however is that Jeff Bezos also said that to \u0026ldquo;invent\u0026rdquo; Amazon he used components that were already invented. That is, the logistics infrastructure that was used by Amazon to make deliveries and the online payments processing infrastructure.\nThese two components were necessary for Jeff Bezos to invent Amazon but he didn\u0026rsquo;t have to invent them. He combined two already existing technologies, online payments processing infrastructure \u0026amp; logistics infrastructure for fulfilling deliveries. This is why I say that technology is \u0026ldquo;combinatorial\u0026rdquo; meaning that it is a combination of other technologies.\nBut Amazon isn\u0026rsquo;t only built up of two components i.e prerequisites that it needs to work. It is built up of programming languages, browser technology, networking infrastructure, microprocessors, electricity and many other components.\nThese many other technologies \u0026ldquo;combine\u0026rdquo; to make Amazon possible.\nSome people suggest that it is more difficult today to invent new technology because all the \u0026ldquo;low hanging fruit is gone\u0026rdquo; or because \u0026ldquo;we are running out of things to invent \u0026ldquo;.\nThe good news is that if we think of technology as being combinatorial. Then it would mean that the number of new technologies to discover will only increase with time i.e with each new discovery.\nWhy? For illustration the fact that technologies are combination of other technologies means that there is no basket from which we are pulling discoveries from.\nThe people that suggest technological progress will slow down assume that there is a finite amount of things to be discovered, and that each new technological discovery brings the bucket is closer to being empty.\nIf we are to think of technologies as a combination of other technologies then we shall conclude the above suggestion may be false.\nConsider two technologies 'A' and 'B'. If we create a new technology by combining those two we now have a new technology called 'AB'. So in total we have three technologies i.e 'A', 'B' and 'AB' instead of two.\nNow we have three technologies to combine instead of two. Which gives us 'A', 'B', 'AB', 'AAB', 'BAB', and 'ABAB'. The new technologies \u0026lsquo;AAB\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;BAB\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;ABAB\u0026rsquo; are a result of combining 'A', 'B' and 'AB' together. Now we have six technologies to combine in different ways that will even lead to more technology that can also provide more ways for technology to create new technology. This is the phenomena referred to by Brian Arthur as increasing returns. 6\nThe mathematical abstraction above illustrated that starting with only two technological components, combining them in different ways gives us a larger set of technologies and thus a higher potential to create new technologies not less.\nIn reality we can apply this method of thought. Think of the combination of chemicals for example used make lithium ion batteries, these batteries can be used to make other technologies like Electric Cars, Laptops, Smart Watches and autonomous drones.\nThe framework can also be applied in software. Many software developers creating open source libraries for example does not make it less likely for developers to create new software.\nThe available open source libraries can be combined in many ways to create new open source software which will also make it possible to make new combinations of software libraries that will be used to create an even larger set of possible software.\nSo if technological progress actually slows down in the real world the reason should never be that \u0026ldquo;we are running out of ideas\u0026rdquo; or that, \u0026ldquo;the law hanging fruit is gone\u0026rdquo;. The reasons may be more cultural that technical. It is less likely to be less hours spent on home work or lower IQ points of the population.\nAlso, if you are a wannabe inventor, another blueprint for creating ideas is to think of how to combine different technologies and then later think of what this combination can be used for — Instead of first thinking about a solution/problem and then trying to look for the right combination that will solve the problem. This can be regarded as a form of non-teleological invention. That is, inventing something whose purpose or use u may not know of at first creation.\n3. Technology transmutes # My last take away from this book is that \u0026ldquo;Technology transmutes\u0026rdquo; and to transmute means \u0026ldquo;to change form\u0026rdquo;.\nBrian Arthur defines technology as a set of techniques or devices used to satisfy a human need.\nSo to him things like postal services, Yellow Page telephone directories, accounting techniques, drafting of building designs and writing are all forms of technologies.\nThe following technologies listed above however don\u0026rsquo;t remain as they are. When new technological break troughs that are otherwise unrelated are made. They often encounter these existing technologies.\nThis encounter then fosters a transmutation i.e the recent break troughs from otherwise unrelated fields interact with previous/old/existing technologies to create something that is related both but also different.\nA clear example of this may be the postal service. Computer technology was initially developed for its number crunching abilities — very little todo with communication, but combined with networking and suitable user interfaces. It encountered the concept of a postal service and transmuted/transformed it into a new sub industry of electronic mail (e-mail services like Gmail).\nWe see this with the writing of books or documents on pen/pencil \u0026amp; paper being transmuted into the use of word processors like Scrivener or Microsoft Word. Writing in a computer\u0026rsquo;s word processor software is very different from writing on a piece of paper with a pen. Papers do not require keyboards, nor do pens require electricity. The two new paradigms of technology are not obviously related. Computer technology \u0026amp; software encountered the act of writing and transmuted it from writing on paper with a pen to using a keyboard on computer software. Although the activity is still writing i.e the output of text, by a human using a set of devices.\nYahoo Web Directory trying to mimic Yellow Pages business directory.\nAccounting/book keeping transmuting into spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel or software like Quick Books.\nThe drafting of building designs on pencil \u0026amp; paper transmuting into something like ArchiCad.\nTelevisions programs transmuting into something like YouTube.\nAnd Radio stations transmuting into something like Podcasts.\nSo what is a good action point for a wannabe inventor, venture capitalist, or school that wants to foster creation of new technology?\nWe need to develop consilience amongst professionals, students and researchers.\nConsilience is the exploration of several disciplines (especially those that are not directly related) and then using the insights from multiple disciplines to think in terms of analogies.\nAn example of the role of consilience is in the development of ArchiCad. ArchiCad is a software program used by Architects for drafting building designs. So you might think that it was developed by Architects right? No.\nArchitects did not invent ArchiCad because they are too busy being top tier architects.\nArchiCad was created by one, Gábor Bojár a Physicist by training and Jonathan Ingram, a Civil Engineer and computer science PhD.\nAnyways here is the concern. Architects are not updated enough in what\u0026rsquo;s happening in the field of computing/programming to know what programs can be built to be useful — and computer scientists/programmers don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Architecture for them to make programs that will be comprehensively useful to Architects\nThis dilemma of requiring \u0026ldquo;off-topic\u0026rdquo; knowledge in order to create a new form of technology is something that is recurrent.\nYou cannot design software for music producers, like FL Studio, Logic Pro or Cubase. If you have neither produced music nor worked around producers.\nYou cannot come up with an MRI scanner for detecting cancer tumors like Raymond Damadian did7. If you do not know about the basic composition of a cancer tumor. It will not matter how fantastic an electric engineer you are if you don\u0026rsquo;t have this \u0026ldquo;off-topic\u0026rdquo; knowledge in the realm of medicine that describes the basic properties of a tumor in a human body.\nIf you want an extra blueprint, in your tool box of ways to come up with new technologies, it would be that you should look into what other people are doing in other professions, or activities that are not obviously relate to each other and this will give you a larger possible set of activities that you can transmute.\nI believe this action point of developing consilience, reveals some of the short comings of specialization and vindicates the value of hobbies/exploration/pondering outside our fields of scholarship, research and professions.\nAn interview I recommend related to this topic is one given by David Eliot Shaw, I have linked a video to the exact time stamp where he proposes this \u0026ldquo;right brain thinking\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;thinking in analogies\u0026rdquo; as advice to young and upcoming scientists 8.\nLike I said this should not be regarded as a summary of the book it is more of a review and a few take aways. If you like technology you are very likely to enjoy the book and I suggest you read it.\nHere is a link to the book.

Computer technology was initially developed for its number crunching abilities — very little todo with communication, but combined with networking and suitable user interfaces. It encountered the concept of a postal service and transmuted/transformed it into a new sub industry of electronic mail (e-mail services like Gmail).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe see this with the writing of books or documents on pen/pencil \u0026amp; paper being transmuted into the use of word processors like Scrivener or Microsoft Word. Writing in a computer\u0026rsquo;s word processor software is very different from writing on a piece of paper with a pen. Papers do not require keyboards, nor do pens require electricity. The two new paradigms of technology are not obviously related.\nComputer technology \u0026amp; software encountered the act of writing and transmuted it from writing on paper with a pen to using a keyboard on computer software.

Languages like J however were designed to be a replacement to traditional maths notation - an interface for thinking or a tool of thought as their inventor Kenneth E. Iverson called them in his Turing Award lecture.\nIn this blog post I am going to introduce the J programming language by using it as a \u0026ldquo;tool of thought\u0026rdquo; to explain the 1 dimensional random walk.\nTo try out the code yourself you will have to install the J interpreter. The easiest way to get it working on Mac is through running the brew formula brew install --cask j. For other platforms, see the installation instructions.\nFirst, a random walk in 5 lines. # The 1 dimensional random walk is a toy model used in finance for creating what may look like stock market prices. In it\u0026rsquo;s simplest form, a 1 dimensional random walk consists of;\nSeveral steps (a list of values), and at each step (for each value) it is either up (indicated by +1) or down (indicated by -1). Note that the value of each step -1 or +1 is chosen at random. Hence the term \u0026lsquo;random walk\u0026rsquo;. So a random walk is basically a list of -1 and +1 generated at random. To attain the \u0026lsquo;synthetic price\u0026rsquo; or what looks like stock prices, we simply compute the running sum of this list of random -1 and +1 integers. The entire toy model of prices we described above is created using the J code below. Let me describe how.\nload \u0026#39;plot\u0026#39; NB. Import the utility for plotting charts indices =: ? 100#2 NB. Generate indices walks =: indices { _1 1 NB. Use indices to create list of -1 \u0026amp; +1 integers running_sum =: +/\\ walks NB. Compute synthetic price plot running_sum NB. Plot the running sum Generating indices. # An index refers to the position of an item in a list. For example, the list 1 2 3 4 has the indices 0 for 1, 2, 3, with the index 0 referring to 1, the index 1 referring to 2, the index 2 referring to 3 and the index 3 referring to 4.\nLine 2, indices =: ? 100#2 generates indices as follows. The # symbol takes in two values 2 and 100 and what it does is that it \u0026ldquo;copies\u0026rdquo; 2 into an list 100 times. For example 5#1 copies 1 five times to give 1 1 1 1 1. So 100#2 returns 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... 2 up to the 100\u0026rsquo;th 2.\nThe ? symbol generates random numbers, you can think of it as rolling a dice. For example, ? 5 may randomly return 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. So ? 5 can be read as \u0026ldquo;generate a random number below 5\u0026rdquo;, 0 is included since the values ? generates are always greater than or equal to 0.\nAnd finally to generate a list of random numbers, we simply give ? a list of numbers for example ? 3 3 3 3 3 may generate 1 1 0 2 2 i.e 5 random numbers under 3. Recall that in line 2, 100#2 generates a list of one hundred 2\u0026rsquo;s. ? then takes the list of one hundred 2\u0026rsquo;s and for each 2 it generates a random number less than 2 i.e 0 or 1.\n? 100#2 can be read as \u0026ldquo;generate a list one hundred 2\u0026rsquo;s and for each item in the list, generate a random integer less that 2\u0026rdquo;. This will return a random list of 100 items made up of exclusively 1\u0026rsquo;s and 0\u0026rsquo;s looking like 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 .... We then store this in a variable called indices using =:\nThis is what we shall use as our indices.\nUse indices to create list of -1 \u0026amp; +1 integers. # In line 3, we use our list of 0\u0026rsquo;s and 1\u0026rsquo;s as indices to generate a random walk (random list made up of -1\u0026rsquo;s \u0026amp; +1\u0026rsquo;s). To do this, we use the symbol { in indices { _1 1 that takes in two sets of values, first is the variable indices which is a list of randomly generated 1\u0026rsquo;s \u0026amp; 0\u0026rsquo;s. On the other side of { is _1 1, which represent the directions of our random walk _1 for -1 (down) and 1 for +1 or (up).\nWhat { does is that it \u0026ldquo;pulls\u0026rdquo; items from a list given an index. The list _1 1 has the indices 0 for _1 and 1 for 1, recall that an index refers to the position of an item in the list. So the statement 0 { _1 1 would return _1 and 1 { _1 1 returns 1 from the list.\nA list of indices would also return a list of items, for instance 1 0 0 1 { _1 1 would return 1 _1 _1 1. Which is similar to what indices { _1 1 is doing. Since indices is a list of random one hundred 1\u0026rsquo;s and 0\u0026rsquo;s it will also randomly pull out a list of _1 and 1 thus giving us a list like _1 _1 1 1 _1 _1 _1 _1 _1 _1 1 _1 ... up to the one hundredth index. Which is the random walk of 100 steps.\nWe also store this list into a variable walks using =:.\nCompute the synthetic prices. # In line 4 we use +/\\ the running sum of the random walk. For example +/\\ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 computes the running sum of seven 1\u0026rsquo;s, which gives us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. Which is exactly what we do with +/\\ walks.\nSince walks is made up of randomly generated _1 and 1, it\u0026rsquo;s running sum will equally fluctuate up and down. The running sum of 1 _1 1 _1 _1 _1 1 1 1 _1 _1 will look like 1 0 1 0 _1 _2 _1 0 1 0 _1\nThe running sum (synthetic price) +/\\ walks is then stored inside the variable running_sum with =:\nA random walk in 2 lines. # This post was supposed how to create a random walk in 2 lines of J. So below is the exact code above refactored to run in two lines.\nload \u0026#39;plot\u0026#39; NB. Import the plot library plot +/\\ (?100#2) { _1 1 NB. Plot synthetic price/ random walk Adjusting step size # 100 denotes the number of steps the random walk takes. The more the steps the closer to actual stock prices the plot will look like.\nRandom Walk of 100 steps # Random Walk of 200 steps # Random Walk of 500 steps # Random Walk of 1,000 steps # Random Walk of 10,000 steps # ","content_html":"\u003cp\u003eOf all the many programming languages, none has quite caught my attention like the \u0026ldquo;Iversonian\u0026rdquo;\nprogramming languages, that is, languages like \u003ca href=\"https://tryapl.org/\"\u003eAPL\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://estradajke.github.io/k9-simples/k9/index.html\"\u003eShakti\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/robpike.io/ivy\"\u003eIvy\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/\"\u003eBQN\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.jsoftware.com/\"\u003eJ\u003c/a\u003e - the subject of this blog post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne misconception is that languages like J are in the same caliber  as \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck\"\u003eBrain F**k\u003c/a\u003e and other \u003ca href=\"https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page\"\u003eesoteric\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/topics/golfing-language\"\u003egolfing\u003c/a\u003e languages which are mostly for recreational programming.\nLanguages like J however were designed to be a replacement to traditional maths notation - an interface for thinking or a \u003ca href=\"https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot.htm\"\u003etool of thought\u003c/a\u003e as their inventor \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson\"\u003eKenneth E.

We then store this in a variable called \u003ccode\u003eindices\u003c/code\u003e using \u003ccode\u003e=:\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what we shall use as our indices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"use-indices-to-create-list-of--1--1-integers\"\u003eUse indices to create list of -1 \u0026amp; +1 integers. \u003ca href=\"#use-indices-to-create-list-of--1--1-integers\" class=\"hash\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn line 3, we use our list of 0\u0026rsquo;s and 1\u0026rsquo;s as indices to generate a random walk (random list made up of -1\u0026rsquo;s \u0026amp; +1\u0026rsquo;s).\nTo do this, we use the symbol \u003ccode\u003e{\u003c/code\u003e in \u003ccode\u003eindices { _1 1\u003c/code\u003e that takes in two sets of values, first is the variable \u003ccode\u003eindices\u003c/code\u003e which is a list of randomly generated 1\u0026rsquo;s \u0026amp; 0\u0026rsquo;s.

The source of excitement is the idea is that you can use financial markets to do inference — just like machine learning.\nA famous example of such prediction markets are the orange futures. The orange futures market is one that allows entities to buy oranges in advance. How it works, is that one can pay $1,000 to receive 1,000 oranges that will be delivered next year. An interesting side effect of this orange futures market is how it accurately predicts temperatures in certain locations more specifically, the temperature of the locations where the oranges are from.\nBut how is information on temperature reflected in the market meant for selling oranges? Well, what actually happens, is that the orange futures prices rise towards cold weather and drop towards warm weather.\nThis phenomenon can be easily explained by the fact that cold weather reduces orange yields thus causing prices to rise (reasoning from the perspective of supply \u0026amp; demand). This explanation however doesn\u0026rsquo;t account for the fact that the market prices start reacting to temperature changes before they occur. It is as if the market knew what the temperature would be in the future. Hence the name prediction markets.\nHow to buy information from the future # In the example above, predicting temperatures was just a side effect of the orange futures market. But how do we design a market to predict an explicit event? For example, say you want to know if it will rain tomorrow.\nStep 1: Declare an event that will reveal this information — Say you want a market that can predict the weather. For the rain example we can declare the event \u0026ldquo;It will rain tomorrow\u0026rdquo;. Step 2: Define events outcome — Formalize the outcomes of the event. The event \u0026ldquo;It will rain tomorrow\u0026rdquo; has two out comes Yes and No. Step 3: Sell betting tickets — Sell tickets for the event outcomes \u0026ldquo;It will rain tomorrow\u0026rdquo;. Buyers of the tickets have two options Yes tickets and No tickets at equal prices. Buyers are allowed to trade tickets with each other. If it does rain tomorrow, those with Yes tickets receive money 2 times the price of the tickets \u0026amp; those with No get nothing. If it does not rain, those with Yes tickets get nothing \u0026amp; those with No tickets get money 2 times the price of the ticket. Loosely following assumptions made by prediction market theory, the true information on the event outcome for \u0026ldquo;It will rain tomorrow\u0026rdquo; will be reflected reflected in the prices at which buyers are trading the tickets. The ticket with the highest price is the event outcome that is most likely to occur. If Yes tickets are selling for $2 \u0026amp; No tickets are selling for $1. Then we would assume that it will probably rain tomorrow.\nThe assumptions of prediction markets # Prediction markets operate upon 3 main assumptions. The first assumption is that markets are made up exclusively of 3 types agents. A classification of these agents is as follows.\nThe pure gambler, this one doesn’t have the necessary meteorological information. He/She is simply betting at random. The accurate information trader, these traders have information they think points to the fact that it will rain \u0026amp; they are right. Inaccurate information traders, have information they think points to the fact that it will rain. But they are wrong. The second assumption, is that The Information is predictable, this means that amongst all the market participants, at least agent is an Accurate information trader.\nThe last assumption is that people in these market agents will perform a Rational participation. Rational participation means that, speculators will always prefer to place bets on event outcomes which they think they will make money \u0026amp; they will decline from participating in bets where they think they will lose money. For instance, a rational person should not be a pure gambler because they have higher chances of making money by betting on information they know at least something about.\nThe accurate information trader on the other hand will flourish in this market as they will always have the edge in the market \u0026amp; thus make money off clueless gamblers \u0026amp; people signaling wrong information. Meanwhile, agents that always bet on wrong information will go bust or switch to markets where they do better. This is what makes prediction makers so resistant to market manipulation, it’s a system where agents signaling wrong information actively subsidizes people signaling correct information.\nIn theory, markets that repeat themselves should improve with every iteration (since most agents that signal wrong information are bust). Provided all agents have access to finite amounts of money.\nHow to break a prediction market # Prediction markets may be highly resistant to manipulation, but that does not mean they cannot break. For a market to continue doing correct inference (accurate predictions), the sum of money held by the class of Accurate Information traders should always be greater than the sum of money collectively owned by the rest of the agents. This is because all agents have finite amounts of money. And it will not be possible to offset noise incorporated into the market by agents with bad information. This may however improve in subsequent iterations of the market (agents signaling wrong information go bust) thus giving prediction markets a self healing like property.\nIt is often mentioned that prediction markets are based on \u0026ldquo;The wisdom of the crowds\u0026rdquo; \u0026amp; that creates a false analogy where people this it works for the same reason democracy does, but they are actually based on the wisdom of the rationals, a system where people don’t talk about what they don’t know.\n","content_html":"\u003cp\u003eFor years now I have been fascinated by prediction markets.

This isn\u0026rsquo;t even the worst case, pandemics like the the black plague killed over 200 million (60% of Europe\u0026rsquo;s population at the time) about 2 times a bigger death toll than any war we have ever had3.\nPandemics \u0026amp; Preparedness # Pandemics are real \u0026amp; unpredictable as we have seen with Ebola 4, SARs 5, and at the time of this writing, the Corona virus6.\nThe problem is that, we are often not prepared for these pandemics. For instance, during the Ebola pandemic in West Africa, 11,000 died simply because the responsible bureaucrats could not mobilize enough resources in time.\nPandemic Bonds and how they work # There was an idea from the World Health Organization (WHO) to use create a kind of insurance market they call a Pandemic bond.7\nHow it would work is that,\nFirst, a pool of money (equivalent to whats needed to finance an Ebola pandemic) would be put up by speculators. Second, The WHO would then continuously pay the speculators a kind of insurance premium. But if a new Ebola out break occurred in a new country, the WHO would use the pool of money (put up by the speculators) to facilitate the mitigation of Ebola in that region. This is obviously an over simplification of the 300 plus page document that explains how these pandemic bonds actually work8 but I hope you get the idea? Its basically health insurance for everyone subsidized by the WHO. Trust minimized pandemic bonds # The pandemic bonds have however become controversial9 probably due to their poor mechanism design10. Despite this fact, I think mechanism designers can come up with better mechanisms resembling these \u0026ldquo;pandemic bonds\u0026rdquo; that actually work in a society.\nThe great thing about Smart-contracts like Solidity11, Scilla12 \u0026amp; Simplicity13 is that, they allow us to design trust minimized financial instruments, thus incorporating a strain of these pandemic bonds into what is now popularly defined as DeFI or decentralized finance14.\nWe can have several of these DeFi (Decentralized Finance) powered applications to mitigate several problems around disease.\nFor instance, Animal husbandry businesses can pay these premiums to mitigate risks around animal disease pandemics like bird flu or mad cow disease. Charities or Governments can pay these premiums to to secure resources for fighting pandemic out breaks like the recent Corona virus. The recent Corona virus for example is so new, there exists no cure15. In such a case, the pool speculators put up would be used for research towards the creation of a vaccine. Event Derivatives # Another way of using DeFi to mitigate disease pandemics is by leveraging prediction markets like Augur16 \u0026amp; Gnosis17 to create an \u0026ldquo;event derivative\u0026rdquo; that may assist in the mitigation of a disease. Event derivatives are markets that pay people for accurately predicting events in the future18\nAn example event derivative is a market we can call, \u0026ldquo;Will it rain on Thursday, next week?\u0026rdquo;. Before Thursday next week, people can bet \u0026ldquo;YES\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;NO\u0026rdquo; on if it will really rain on that day. If it rains, people who bet \u0026ldquo;YES\u0026rdquo; win the bet \u0026amp; people who voted \u0026ldquo;NO\u0026rdquo; have their money transferred to people that bet \u0026ldquo;YES\u0026rdquo;.\nComing back to disease pandemics, we can have a question like \u0026ldquo;Will there be a vaccine for Corona viral infections?\u0026rdquo;.

A \u0026ldquo;trust machine\u0026rdquo; as some people call it, that will bring the power of finance, data sovereignty and inclusion to the people, hence rendering centralized intermediaries like Visa, Barclays \u0026amp; Facebook obsolete.\nWe shall achieve this by using a combination of robust, battle tested cryptography \u0026amp; game theory.\nWhile this vision is plausible, realising it is not a easy as it may seem.\nThe blockchain is not yet ready.\nThe core barriers to main stream adoption # The blockchain, while being a new concept in decentralized distributed databases has also presented a very unique set of problems in computer science \u0026amp; economics that have never been solved at the time of this writing.\nIs this post, I will talk about the the 6 most important issues only with which if solved, shall we (blockchain enthusiasts) ever achieve our vision.\n1. Scalability Issues # The current bandwidth, i.e the data that can be transmitted through a blockchain with in a given time is simply too bounded for main stream adoption.\nEthereum for instance does a maximum of 13 transactions per second. Visa on the other hand can do 24,000 Transaction per second and peak over 40,000 transactions per second.\nSo as you can see, the blockchain is thousands of magnitudes unable to manage a global traffic of financial transactions. This is what they call the \u0026ldquo;Scalability Problem\u0026rdquo;\nComing up with a solution to scalability the problems without tarnishing the original value propositions of a blockchain (immutability/security, decentralization \u0026amp; censorship resistance) is not trivial. It has been nick named the \u0026ldquo;scalability trilemma\u0026rdquo; by Vitalik Buterine (Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s co-author).\n2. Lack of Intuitive Private Key Management # Ordinary users will simply never wrap their heads around private keys.\nPrivate keys, which are a string of text used to sign transactions and make other proofs(cryptographic).\nThe purpose for these proofs or signatures is for other entities on a blockchain network to verify identities \u0026amp; messages amongst themselves without reasonable doubt.\nPrivate keys have two main problems first, how to store them securely. Anyone who can memorize, take a picture, or copy your private key can literally steal all your money. Because they have your private key, they can make the cryptographic proofs/signatures and accurately prove to everyone on the network they are you even without your consent. Even when they are not you.\nSecond, you loose your key you loose access to all your money \u0026amp; no one can ever help you out. There is no \u0026ldquo;click here to remember your private key\u0026rdquo;\nWe need to first come up with something as intuitive using ATM/Debit cards.\nImagine if your bank told you that, \u0026ldquo;if you forgot your Debit card PIN, you loose access to all your money with zero hope of recovering it how ever large a sum of money it would be\u0026rdquo;.\nIf the above was the case, I don\u0026rsquo;t think any one would use debit cards.\n3. Contract security # It is simply not reliable \u0026amp; safe for responsible institutions \u0026amp; individuals to deploy smart contracts on blockchains like Ethereum.\nDue to the blockchain having an immutable and unpredictable state, Smart contracts deployed on such a platform are also expected to suffer from immutable bugs \u0026amp; unpredictable events.\nAs a result, millions of dollars have been lost in events such as the theft of $50 million from TheDAO and Parity\u0026rsquo;s $160 Million loss of funds\nI was glad that Rick dudley talked about this\n4. Consensus algorithms are wack # The popular blockchains only don\u0026rsquo;t offer transaction finality i.e you will never be 100% sure that you have gotten funds.\nYou can only be probabilistically to a high degree (but with zero guarantee) that you have received your funds. This is because in major consensus algorithm called Nakamoto Consensus, the miners elect the chain with the most computational work that are with in the same protocol i.e consensus rules.\nFor instance imagine your bank tells you that you that, \u0026ldquo;there is a 95% chance that we might have your life savings, however you may also not poses it in 5 years in case we discovered that the chain with the most work does not have your transaction in it\u0026rdquo;\nYes, I don\u0026rsquo;t think anyone wants to keep their life savings in such a bank.\n5. Privacy # Just by knowing someone\u0026rsquo;s cryptocurrency address, you can know their account balance \u0026amp; transaction history simply by pasting it in a blockchain explorer like blockchain and etherscan\nMeaning it\u0026rsquo;s very easy for anyone to keep track of your financial activities without permission.\nYou buy HIV drugs?
