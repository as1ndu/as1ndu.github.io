So we need to switch to the less pathologically operated Firefox — this post is not about that.</p><p>I recently switched to Firefox from Chrome. I felt like I was missing out on so much.</p><p>Chrome is simply <em>no longer better</em> than Firefox, features wise. <em>Firefox is now the superior browser!</em></p><hr><p>I recently felt like I should just &ldquo;try out&rdquo; Firefox.</p><p>So I installed it on my phone, this post is about features on Firefox Mobile that I suspect will never exist in chrome.</p><h2 id=firefox-extensions>Firefox Extensions <a href=#firefox-extensions class=hash>#</a></h2><p>Chrome extensions are only limited to the desktop version.</p><p>Not with Firefox Mobile, with Firefox mobile you can install extensions on the mobile browser. So you can actually block all ads on all websites using uBlock Origin&rsquo;s Firefox Extension.</p><p>You can also install many other browser extensions. As I have below. This will probably never exist in chrome on mobile.</p><p><img src=/files/10-switching-to-firefox/extensions_list.jpg alt="List of My installed  Extensions" loading=lazy></p><h2 id=view-pdfs-in-browser>View PDFs in browser <a href=#view-pdfs-in-browser class=hash>#</a></h2><p>I usually find my self following links that are not to web pages but PDF files.</p><p>Chrome on mobile has requires you to download the PDF file and is still not even capable of viewing them.</p><p>You will have to use a clunky third party app like Google Drive to view the contents of the PDF.</p><p>I expected this behavior on Firefox mobile. But everything just loaded nicely. I&rsquo;m browser, without the need to download it or use third party clunky PDF reader apps.</p><p>PDFs on Firefox mobile were simply loaded fast, with panning, zooming capability and a download button incase you want it stored locally.</p><p>Everything with web hosted PDFs has become much more convenient with Firefox mobile.</p><p><img src=/files/10-switching-to-firefox/pdf.jpg alt="Reading the Bitcoin Whitepaper PDF without having to download it" loading=lazy></p><h2 id=automatic-history-deletion>Automatic History Deletion <a href=#automatic-history-deletion class=hash>#</a></h2><p>On chrome, there is &ldquo;incognito&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t Keep any browsing history after exiting. A similar product on Firefox is &ldquo;private tabs&rdquo;.</p><p>However, Firefox has something more bespoke for &ldquo;power users&rdquo;.</p><p>Suppose you only want your browsing history wiped out, but don&rsquo;t want to log in again after opening the browser?</p><p>For this, Firefox has &ldquo;delete browsing data on quit&rdquo;. You won&rsquo;t need need to use &ldquo;private tabs&rdquo; for this (Chrome&rsquo;s incognito equivalent) it just works in the default Firefox tabs.</p><p>Every time you hit the &ldquo;quite&rdquo; button, Firefox will automatically wipe out the browsing history according to your exact specifications.</p><p><img src=/files/10-switching-to-firefox/delete_browsing_data_on_quit.jpg alt="Delete browsing data on quit" loading=lazy></p><h2 id=a-word-to-the-mozilla-team>A word to the Mozilla team <a href=#a-word-to-the-mozilla-team class=hash>#</a></h2><p>Okay so given all this, Firefox still isn&rsquo;t perfect.</p><p>Only one thing would make it perfect and better than Chrome in every possible way, feature wise.</p><p>The feature is <code>about:config</code>. In chrome the equivalent feature is called <code>chrome://flags</code>.</p><p>What funny is that it actually existed before and was simply turned off for about 4 years at the time of this writing.</p><p>It even still exists in Firefox Mobile Nightly (a buggy version of Firefox for testers).</p><p>The reasons for Firefox turning this off are very unsatisfactory. And many Firefox power users are begging for it to be returned <sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></p><p>If anyone on the Firefox team can make that happen, please do 🙏🏿</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>While the moral reasons for switching to Firefox should be taken to account, I think it&rsquo;s time to let people know that Firefox is not just the morally right choice, but not using it actually means your missing out on a lot — <a href=https://archive.is/Ae7f2>https://archive.is/Ae7f2</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>Link to the Mozilla connect forum around people discussing their need for <code>about:config</code> to be returned on Firefox mobile — <a href=https://archive.is/iu30k>https://archive.is/iu30k</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></span><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//asindu.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></section><hr><footer><small><span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">∆ Built with <a style=color:#7fffd4 href=https://gohugo.io>hugo</a> & <a style=color:#7fffd4 href=https://github.com/ronv/lines>lines</a>.</span></small><p><small><span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace"><a style=color:#7fffd4 href=/contact-us>Contact Us</a> |
