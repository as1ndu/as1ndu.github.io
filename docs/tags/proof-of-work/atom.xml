The main decision often cited from this transition is the claim that Bitcoin’s proof of work is a “waste of electricity”.
Even the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTxRF5ag27A">creator of C++ complained about it&lt;/a>. But now I am talking about why we may need proof of work on layer 2 yet everyone is trying to get rid of it from layer 1 (the networking layer at which &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency.asp">consensus&lt;/a> is made). Why?
First, before we think of substitutes to proof of work, we need to acknowledge the role of proof of work in a system like bitcoin.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
